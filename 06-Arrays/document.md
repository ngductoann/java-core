## Arrays

> An arrays is a data structure that allows we to store a sequence of values, all
> of the same types.

We can have arrays for any primitive type, like ints, doubles, booleans, or in
fact, any of the 8 primitives. And, we can also have arrays for any class.

Elements in an arrays are indexed, starting at 0. If we have an array storing
five names, conceptually, it looks as show here:

| Index                                     | 0      | 1     | 2         | 3       | 4     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------ | ----- | --------- | ------- | ----- |
| Stored values in an array with 5 elements | "Andy" | "Bod" | "Charlie" | "David" | "Eve" |

The first element is at index 0 and is Andy. The last element in this array is
at index 4 and has the String value Eve.
